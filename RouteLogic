fetch stop with closest coordinates to destination, verify stop is going in correct direction
fetch stop with closest coordinates to start point, verify route has correct heading
call next stop in route



since were only covering Hillsborough, I like "depth first search style"
If original stop coordinate heading is N, head north until next-next stop coordinate is beyond destination
    at which point fetch potential routes heading E/W, check next 2 stops (from the N route) to see which is closer

Idk, I'll think on it some more, I'm starting to get a bit delusional


swtich (original-stop-heading)
case 0: N continue N
case 1: E continue E
case 2: S continue S
case 3: W continue W


From Chris:

4. If we haven't done it yet, we need to be able to carry the destination CLLocation and starting CLLocation forward to the last view controller.  When we get to the final view controller (after the starting point map) we will, in the viewDidLoad method we'll need to do the following things:
	a. take the destination CLLocation and find bus stops within some distance (500 meters, say) of that CLLocation; each of these stops will come with a list of routes that stop on that bus stop
	b. take the starting CLLocation and do the same thing.
	c. pick the routes that service both locations; this is the set intersection of the route ids for routes that service the starting and ending stops we just got.
once we've got that list of routes, we can display that list in a table view.
